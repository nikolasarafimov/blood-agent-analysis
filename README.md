# 🩸 Blood Agent — AI-Powered Blood Test Analysis Platform

An end-to-end AI system for automated blood test processing, combining OCR, anonymization, structured data extraction, and LOINC enrichment through a unified agent-based pipeline.

This project integrates **LLM agents**, **medical data processing**, **FastAPI**, **MinIO object storage**, and a **React UI** to provide a complete workflow from raw medical documents to structured, anonymized, semantically enriched laboratory data.

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 Upload blood test PDFs or images  
- 🔍 OCR & text extraction (PDF + image support)  
- 🔒 Automatic anonymization of personal identifiers  
- 🧠 LLM-based medical data extraction  
- 🧬 Structured JSON output for lab results  
- 🧾 LOINC code validation & enrichment  
- ☁️ Object storage via MinIO (Bronze / Silver layers)  
- 🌐 FastAPI backend with Swagger UI  
- 💬 React-based web UI  
- 🤖 Agent-orchestrated pipeline (PydanticAI)

## 🧪 Processing Pipeline

1. Upload blood test document (PDF or image)  
2. OCR & text extraction  
3. Store raw data in Bronze layer (MinIO)  
4. Anonymize personal identifiers  
5. Convert anonymized text to structured JSON  
6. Validate & enrich results with LOINC codes  
7. Store final outputs in Silver layer  

Each step is orchestrated by an **LLM agent** using tool-based execution.

- This project was developed for **academic and research purposes only**.
- It is **not a certified medical device** and must **not** be used for clinical diagnosis, treatment, or medical decision-making.
- All uploaded documents are processed through an **automated anonymization pipeline** to remove personally identifiable information (PII); however, users are responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable data protection regulations.
- The system is intended to demonstrate **AI-assisted document processing**, **medical data structuring**, and **semantic enrichment** techniques.
- Outputs generated by large language models may contain inaccuracies and should always be reviewed by qualified professionals when used in real-world contexts.
